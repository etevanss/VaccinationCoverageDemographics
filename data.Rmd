# Data 

## Sources

### Flu Vaccine Coverage Dataset
Longyuan Gao was primarily responsible for collecting the data within our team. The influenza vaccine coverage data is collected from the CDC, as stated in the previous chapter. The dataset is comprehensive in the sense that it records the coverage rate for every state and region in the United States. Although there is some missing data (June coverage data, for example), the overall quality is adequate for us to conduct visualizations. The data is collected from the National Immunization Survey-Flu (NIS-Flu), a national wide survey on vaccination coverage conducted by phone, and the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, which is another telephone survey. To obtain the CSV file, we downloaded it from the webpage.

Here is some basic information about this dataset:

Variables: vaccine type, geography(state/county/region, corresponding name, and a FIPS number), season(year), month, dimension(type(age/ethnicity), metric(>6 year, e.g.)), estimated coverage, sample size, and CI.

Number of records: roughly 185,000

Problems: There are certain time periods where data is completely missing (like June 2021), and all the cells are in character form rather than numeric form. This will require some data transformation.

### Demographic Datasets

For demographics data, we utilized all three nationwide census datasets (population, education attainment, and income) listed in the previous chapter. The census data come from 2021, just like the flu shot dataset. Thus, we can compare flu vaccine coverage rate with demographic information in the same time frame. It is collected by the annual American Community Survey conducted by Census Bureau. The data is available for download right on the webpage.

Here is some basic information about these datasets:

Variables and number of records: 

Education attainment: age groups by education attainment (for example, high school degree for people >25), race groups by education, poverty rate, median earnings, etc. This dataset is not tidy, so we are to decide which metrics are variables.There is  about 1 observation for each state.

Population: similar to the education dataset, it is not tidy. Variables are age groups (<5, 5-9, etc.), selected age categories, statistical summaries, etc., and about 1 observation for each state.

Income: total population in that state, income ranges, median, mean, etc., about 1 observation for each state.

Problems:

All of these datasets store variables in character form, so we have to spend time transforming these characters to numeric. Also, these datasets are in a nested column form, meaning that there are columns within a column if we view them in software like Excel. This poses a challenge for cleaning as well. Moreover, there are so many variables that we do not need, so we also need to deal with the extraneous columns.

### COVID-19 Cases Dataset

For the COVID-19 cases data, I again downloaded it from the CDC website, as documented above. The dataset starts in 2020 and ends in 2022 which overlaps the flu shots data in the years 2020 and 2021, giving us the opportunity to visualize some trends in COVID cases and flu shots in the same time frame. The data is collected by local reports and is available for downloading online.

Variables: submission date, state, total number of cases, total probable cases, total confirmed cases, number of new cases, number of new probable cases, total number of deaths, total number of confirmed deaths

Number of Records: roughly 60,100

Problems: There are many variables that are unnecessary for our analyses. Thus, we have to select relevant columns before we conduct the analysis. Many cells have NA values and 0s which lead to a sparse dataset.

## Data Cleaning and Transformation

### Flu Vaccine Coverage Dataset

First, we extracted the year of the record from the season column, since the number after year in that column is not the month. Then we combine the year with month in the month column, convert it to a date type and store it in a new column called "ym". Also, we convert the column Estimate (the estimated coverage rate) from character to numeric. 

### Demographic Datasets

For these datasets, we transform them more or less in the same way. First, we only kept columns (which contain data for each state) with estimated values for each state, and transpose the dataset so that each row contains the metrics for only one state. Then, we changed the row names to the exact name of that state and converted the entries to numeric types. For education, we add a column called "high_school_higher_pop" that represents the total population that counts the number of people that attained at least a high school diploma or equivalent education. For population, we add 3 columns, "children_pop", which counts the number of people 14 and under, "children_ratio", the ratio of children with respect to the total population, and "elder_ratio", the ratio of people 65 or older with respect to total population. For income, we only keep the income data for households (this is the majority of the data), and we calculate the ratio of households who earn less than 14,999 dollars/year (stored in household_poverty_rate) or more than 150,000 dollars/year (stored in household_wealth_rate).

### demo_df, an Enhanced Dataframe
After performing the above transformations, we combined the derived and some raw columns to create the demographics dataset with the flu shot coverage data and form a more concise data frame called "demo_df". We did further feature engineering in this data frame. To be more specific, this new data frame includes the by-state information on 

+ number of people who attained at least a high school or equivalent degree
+ population over 18
+ ratio of population over 18 that received at least a high school or equivalent degree (engineered by dividing 1 by 2)
+ total population
+ population under 14
+ ratio of children (<=14)
+ population over 65
+ ratio of people >=65
+ median household income
+ mean household income
+ household poverty rate
+ household wealth rate
+ influenza vaccine coverage rate

The reason for doing this is that the original datasets are too cumbersome for us to work with.

A second similar dataset, "demo_df_d3", was used for the interactive component of our project. This data frame is identical to "demo_df", with an additional region column to categorize states by their region in the United States (West, South, Northeast, Midwest). These regions were made by the US Census Bureau and are found [here](https://github.com/cphalpert/census-regions/blob/master/us%20census%20bureau%20regions%20and%20divisions.csv).

### us_by_year, an Enhanced Dataframe
This data frame is extracted from the flu shot dataset. In this data frame, we only keep the records for nationwide flu coverage for each month (2009 to 2021) and only records that are related to seasonal influenza, since H1N1 vaccines are only provided in earlier years. We also only care about the age metric, which should be ">6" months which includes all eligible individuals. Again, the reason we extract this specific data frame is to eliminate unnecessary entries for easier plotting, while keeping the original data frame the same in case we need to gather other data from it.

## Missing value analysis

Here we use the naniar package to visualize.

### Flu Vaccination Data
```{r}
library(redav)
library(tidyverse)
library(naniar)
flu <- read.csv("./data/raw/flu_vax_coverage.csv")
flu[c(4,6,9,11)] <-flu[c(4,6,9,11)] %>% 
  mutate_all(function(x){as.numeric(gsub("\\D+","",x))})
gg_miss_upset(flu, nsets = 100)
```

From the plot, we can see that some rows are missing sample size variables, but since that variable is not taken into consideration, we are not concerned with that variable being NA. Also, some rows are missing Estimate which is, however, valuable to us. For rows with missing Estimates, we decided not to impute them, since we cannot be sure what variables it is dependent on. Some rows are also missing estimates and sample sizes together (maybe because that record is completely missing).

Other than the missing columns shown in the graph, we are also observing that some rows are missing, such as all the June data mentioned before which is completely missing without a note. This may be caused by the "reset" of vaccine contents in June of each year. Also, some earlier data contains vaccine coverage data for Asians and Native Americans, but that kind of information is missing in more current data. Thus, we are careful when dealing with this in the dataset: we regularly check if there is missing data in our derived data frame or abnormalities in the plot.

### Demographic datasets

#### Population dataset

Since visualizations for the whole dataset is unhelpful and somewhat meaningless (there are so many columns, and some columns are intended to be NA), we only visualize the missing values on the subsets of the datasets which are used in our analyses. Moreover, if we add features names, the plot will be unreadable. So we decided to leave them in the form "V+number". If there are any missing values, we will dig deeper into that.

```{r}
pop <- read.csv("./data/raw/population.csv")
rowname = pop$Label..Grouping
pop<-pop[str_detect(colnames(pop),"Total..Estimate")] %>% 
  t() %>% 
  as.data.frame() %>%
  mutate_all(function(x){as.numeric(gsub("\\D+","",x))})
pop <- pop[c(1,3:5,32)]
plot_missing(pop)
```
There are no missing values in relevant subsets of the population dataset.

#### Education attaiment dataset

```{r}
education <- read.csv("./data/raw/education.csv")
rowname = education$Label..Grouping
education<-education[str_detect(colnames(education),"Total..Estimate")] %>% 
  t() %>% 
  as.data.frame() %>%
  mutate_all(function(x){as.numeric(gsub("\\D+","",x))})
plot_missing(education[c(2:28)])
```

There are no missing values in relevant subsets of the education dataset.

#### Household income dataset

```{r}
income <- read.csv("./data/raw/income.csv")
rowname <- income$Label..Grouping.
income <- income[str_detect(colnames(income),"Households..Estimate")] %>% 
  t() %>% 
  as.data.frame()%>%
  mutate_all(function(x){as.numeric(gsub("\\D+","",x))})
plot_missing(income[c(1:13)])
```

There are no missing values in relevant subsets of the household income dataset. Note here that the data for nationwide data is missing, but that doesn't matter to our analysis, since we will truncate all nationwide data.

### COVID-19 cases dataset

```{r}
covid <- read.csv("./data/raw/United_States_COVID-19_Cases.csv")
gg_miss_upset(covid[3:12],nset=10)
```

We can observe that the most missing pattern is conf_cases(confirmed cases), prob_cases (total probable cases), conf_death (confirmed deaths), and prob_death. This can be caused by missing all reports for a certain day. The second most frequent missing pattern is conf_death and prob_death which both focus on the death count. The third most missing pattern is conf_cases and prob_cases, which is a similar situation as the second pattern. There are also about 3400 rows that are missing all confirmed and probable case and death counts. Other than these observable patterns, there are a few rows that have their own specific missing patterns, which may be caused by record errors.
